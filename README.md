# LibRawFX
Integration of LibRaw (https://www.libraw.org) library for JavaFX for all major operating systems (Linux, Windows, OSX). 
All raw formats can be loaded with the Image class and manipulated by Pixelwriter/Pixelreader. Limitation is that the image class only supports 8-bit color deph but converts all 16bit image format to 8bit automatically.

**JDK 18 is required for 1.8.0** because of the foreign linker API usage and the big changes for threading happenend in Panama in JDK18

**JDK 19 is required for 1.8.1** because of the foreign linker API usage and the big changes for threading happenend in Panama in JDK19

## Status
Now the lib is in production ready status. That means it is tested on all operating systems (OSX, Linux, Win10) and under different threading scenarious.

Supported OS:
- Linux (min. glibc 2.27 which means Ubuntu 18 or later)
- OSX 12.5 including Apple M1
- Windows 10/11

I have integrated LibRaw SNAPSHOT version 202110 (https://www.libraw.org/news/libraw-202110-snapshot)

Actually only the following raw formats are enabled (see class `RAWDescriptor.java`):
- Adobe DNG
- Nikon NEF
- Canon CRW/CR2
- SIMGA Merrill/Quattro X3F
- Fuji X-Trans RAF
- Sony
- Leica

The lib now resized the image in memory before sending it back to the image class (the same as the Javafx is doing for PNG/JPG).

## Open topics
- Writing of metadata back to raw files

## Usage
Point to the maven coordinates:

**JDK18**
```
<dependency>  
    <groupId>org.librawfx</groupId>    
    <artifactId>LibRawFX</artifactId>  
    <version>1.8.0</version>  
</dependency>  
```
**JDK19**
```
<dependency>  
    <groupId>org.librawfx</groupId>    
    <artifactId>LibRawFX</artifactId>  
    <version>1.8.1</version>  
</dependency>  
```

- In the Class where the start method is add as one of the first lines the following code to install the file handler:

     `RAWImageLoaderFactory.install();`  

- and add the following lines to your java config:
```
--add-modules jdk.incubator.foreign --enable-native-access=org.librawfx  
--add-exports=javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.iio=org.librawfx 
--add-exports=javafx.graphics/com.sun.javafx.iio.common=org.librawfx
```

- **Metadata**
Just create an instance of class LibrawImage with the file to get the metadata and print the return values
```
HashMap<String, String> metaData = new LibrawImage(initialFile.getAbsolutePath()).getMetaData();
VBox vb = new VBox();
metaData.entrySet().forEach((entry) -> {
   Label l = new Label(entry.getKey() + " " + entry.getValue());
   vb.getChildren().add(l);
});
```

- **Module name: org.librawfx**

You can have a look into the class TestAPP.java to see how to use it, but generally just create an Image with the URL/stream and add it to the image view:

```
  Image img=new Image(initialFile.toURI().toURL().toString(), false);  
  ImageView view = new ImageView();  
  view.setFitHeight(200);  
  view.setFitWidth(200);  
  view.setPreserveRatio(true);  
  stack.getChildren().add(view);  
  view.setImage(img);
```  

You can also use the lib without adding the file handler. What I mean is that you can also forget the "...install" line and just load a file URL with the lib (see the `TestApp.java` to see how it works).

## Steps to create your own build:
- OpenJDK/Adoptium 19 or newer
- JavaFX 11 or newer (18 is recommended)
- SET JAVA_HOME variable
- Execute `mvn clean compile package -f LibRawFX/pom.xml`
- To run the example execute `mvn javafx:run@cli-default`
- IDE Integration: execute as a maven goal `javafx:run@ide-debug` or `javafx:run@ide-profile`

# Notes:
- The lib is using unoffical JavaFX interfaces
- The lib is using heavily the foreign memory API from Java 18 including functions from the project Panama and therefore the tool `JExtract` (Available only in JDK 19)
- All classes inside of package `org.libraw.win` / `org.libraw.linuxosx` are generated by jextract but tuned for operating system specifica
- Inside of these packages above I exposed also the raw interface to libraw
- The main class to interact with the native lib is the class `LibrawImage.java` in package `org.librawfx`
